# Welcome to my GitHub Profile 👋!

Hi! I'm Ángel, from the Canary Islands 🇮🇨🌴. I'm currently working managing a shop's Wordpress sites: content, SEO, marketing...

### Formation and Laboral Experience 📚

<details>

- Scientific and Technological Baccalaureate (2021-2023) 🎓
- Higher Degree in Web-Applications Development (DAW) (2023-2025) 🎓
  - Internship at Elantia (2 months) 💼

#### What's next? 🔜

I am currently looking to return to my studies, exploring fields that align more with my passion and professional aspirations. While I have many options, the one I am most drawn to is psychology. The way the human mind works is incredibly fascinating, and I would find fulfillment in applying it to listen without judgment, understand people, and offer support during challenging times.

### Programming Skills 🐍

<details>

I have basic knowledge of SQLite, SQL, Markdown, Shell, Bash, and the Bootstrap library. Additionally, I have solid skills in HTML, CSS, and Python.  

Along the way, I gained beginner-level experience with Python's Django framework, which I find to be an incredible and powerful tool for creating interesting web applications in a relatively easy way.

Also I completed my FCT (Working Centers Formation) at Elantia, a digital marketing enterprise, where I learned a lot about SEO and WPO tools.

While these aren't directly programming languages, they're invaluable for creating faster and more efficient web applications, as well as enhancing user experiences.

#### Personal Progamming Projects 💻
  
- **Python Wordle 🔤**: A humble recreation of Wordle in Python. It features a list of Spanish words, and the program, powered by the `random` library, selects a word for the player to guess within a limited number of attempts.

- **Realejos Summer League ⚽**: A Django-based web application for managing a real futsal competition that my friend and I will organize some day. Initially, it was a simple HTML page with a little CSS to inform participants, but thanks to my teacher [sdelquin](https://github.com/sdelquin), I learned Django and expanded it into a functional web application.

## Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hi! I'm Ángel, a current Web Applications Development student from the Canary Islands 🇮🇨🌴.

# Studies and programming skills 🖥️

During this two-year module, I gained some foundational programming skills and learned several basic languages, which I'm currently working to improve and expand upon.

### Programming Skills 🐍

I have basic knowledge of SQLite, SQL, Markdown, Shell, Bash, and the Bootstrap library. Additionally, I have solid skills in HTML, CSS, and Python.  

Along the way, I gained beginner-level experience with Python's Django framework, which I find to be an incredible and powerful tool for creating interesting web applications in a relatively easy way.

### Currently learning 💼💰​🧠​

I'm currently completing my FCT (Working Centers Formation) at Elantia, a digital marketing enterprise, where I'm learning about exciting SEO and WPO tools.

While these aren't directly programming languages, they're invaluable for creating faster and more efficient web applications, as well as enhancing user experiences.

### What I would like to learn ☕

Nowadays, practically all modern websites rely on JavaScript, a powerful tool for creating interactivity and improving user experiences. It's a skill I would love to master to create even more engaging projects.

### Personal Projects 🦆

Here are a couple of personal projects I've worked on in my free time:

- **Python Wordle**: A humble recreation of Wordle in Python. It features a list of Spanish words, and the program, powered by the `random` library, selects a word for the player to guess within a limited number of attempts.

- **Realejos Summer League**: A Django-based web application for managing a real futsal competition that my friend and I will organize in Summer 2025. Initially, it was a simple HTML page with a little CSS to inform participants, but thanks to my teacher [sdelquin](https://github.com/sdelquin), I learned Django and expanded it into a functional web application.
